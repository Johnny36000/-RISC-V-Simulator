# Risc-v-Simulator
Designed a RISC-V simulator capable of interpreting the 40 basic instructions of RISC-V and simulating it effectively using C++. The model functions by inserting a file full of assembly instructions, and then the simulator translates the instructions and produces the output in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.
